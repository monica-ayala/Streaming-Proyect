***STREAMING SERVICE PROVIDER PROYECT ***

Introduction:

There has been a substantial rise in popularity of streaming services, with big platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO and the like growing exponentially. 
There is a lot that goes into making a streaming service available, from having the server capacity to sustain millions of users, designing an eye-catching 
graphical interface, obtaining distribution licenses for the media that will be uploaded to the site, having pattern-recognizing algorithms to give you 
personalized recommendations for what to watch next, managing subscriptions which involve money transactions, and much more. 

However, the program being developed is a limited model version of the bare minimum requirements to support a streaming service. The program will work with
two types of media: movies and series. They can be both categorized by four types of genres (Drama, Romance, Horror or Comedy) or sorted by their rating.
The user can change the ratings of the movies and series, or even the seriesÂ´ episodes. Additionally, movies have an established duration while series have 
seasons and episodes. They are stored and distinguished from one another by their title names and ID numbers. 

As the streaming service exists to provide service to users, the program will also include basic user interaction. The user will be able to sort the
media in different ways, to change the ratings of the media and to compare two pieces of media and obtain their similarity in percentage. All of
these interactions will be accessed from a menu list until the user decides to exit the program. 

To solve this problem situation we will be in the programming language C++ and it will use object oriented programming 
concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Pointers, Aggregation and Composition. The app will be built using the console, 
which means there will be no Graphical User Interface component to the solution.
